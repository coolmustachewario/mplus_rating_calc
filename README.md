A simple tool to calculate Mythic dungeon rating for Season 3 Dragonflight. 

It lists all keys in Fortified and Tyrannical and should calculate a rough score based on what the in-game calculation does. 

It uses a score table based on this formula: Total Score=20+(adjustedKeyLevel×5)+(nLevelsAbove10×2)+(nAffixes×10), which doesn't account for bonus points (less deaths/faster completion etc), so there's some margin for error. 

In addition, there's a checkbox for which week is active (Fortified/Tyrannical), which will lock the opposite sliders.
